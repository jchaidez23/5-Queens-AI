# **N Queens Problem Implementation Using 5 Queens **
The given task is to implement the N-Queens Problem in Artificial Intelligence using a 5x5 board which holds 5 queens.
In order to solve this problem I was tasked with implementing the hill-climbing algorithm and genetic algorithm in order
to find the most optimal solutions given the beginning state for the board.

# **Concepts**
The project focuses on the following concepts:
  Genetic Algorithm: Search heuristic inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. The algorithm reflects the 
  process of natural selection in order to find the most optimal "candidate."
  Hill-Climbing Algorithm: Simple optimization algorithm used to find the best possible solution for a given problem by,
  making small changes until the optimal solution is found. Hill-Climbing belongs to the local search family in Artificial
  Intelligence.

# ** Files**
Board.py: Given file that will create the board and choose the random starting state for the five queens
Genetic.py: Genetic algorithm implementation that finds the most optimal solution for the board and prints out the run time
Hill.py: Hill-Climbing algorithm implementation that finds the most optimal solution for the board given the starting state
